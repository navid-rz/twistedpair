# Examples

The `examples/` folder contains runnable scripts that demonstrate typical workflows:

- `quickstart.py` — Minimal demonstration to get started quickly.
- `tx_demo.py` — Shows TX waveform generation and pre-emphasis.
- `link_demo.py` — End-to-end TX -> channel -> RX simulation with plots and metrics.
- `psd_test.py` — Power spectral density related experiments.

Run any example with Python. Inspect each script for configurable parameters and preset usage.
